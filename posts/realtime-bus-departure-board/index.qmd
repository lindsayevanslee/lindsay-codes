video loren sent me:

maybe i could do the same thing!

googling what goes into the google maps data

two kinds of feeds, static and realtime: https://developers.google.com/transit

repository of feeds: https://www.transit.land/operators/

search for nashville, found the static feed: http://www.nashvillemta.org/GoogleExport/google_transit.zip

and realtime feed: http://transitdata.nashvillemta.org/TMGTFSRealTimeWebService/vehicle/vehiclepositions.pb

tried to google how to query the realtime feed but couldn't find any clear documentation or example project. turned to chat gpt, and it gave me some sample python code

need to get google maps API code, directions API


1. download static trip information
2. pull buses near me
3. filter to which ones have not yet passed my place on their route
4. calculate time to my place
5. structure data for display
6. set up automation
