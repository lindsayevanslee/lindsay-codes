image-alt: "A diagram depicting how shinylive works from the documentation. The documenation says: When an application is deployed with Shinylive, Python and Shiny run in the web browser: the browser is effectively both the client and server for the application. There is a web server that serves files, but it does not run Python or Shiny—it can be a “dumb” static web server.

This is a Shinylive application embedded in a Quarto doc.

```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true

from shiny import *

app_ui = ui.page_fluid(
    ui.input_slider("n", "N", 0, 100, 40),
    ui.output_text_verbatim("txt"),
)

def server(input, output, session):
    @output
    @render.text
    def txt():
        return f"The value of n*2 is {input.n() * 2}"

app = App(app_ui, server)

```
