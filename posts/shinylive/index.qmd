image-alt: "A diagram depicting how shinylive works from the documentation. The documenation says: When an application is deployed with Shinylive, Python and Shiny run in the web browser: the browser is effectively both the client and server for the application. There is a web server that serves files, but it does not run Python or Shiny—it can be a “dumb” static web server.

Following instructions here: https://github.com/quarto-ext/shinylive

https://pypi.org/project/python-docx/

https://shiny.posit.co/py/docs/shinylive.html#requiring-extra-packages-with-requirements.txt

https://shinylive.io/py/examples/#extra-packages

to get this to work in quarto need to create requirements.txt in the chunk: https://github.com/quarto-ext/shinylive/issues/5


This is a Shinylive application embedded in a Quarto doc.


```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true
#| viewerHeight: 420

import io
import docx
from shiny import App, render, ui

app_ui = ui.page_fluid(
    ui.input_slider("n", "N", 0, 100, 40),
    ui.download_button("download2", "Download")
)

def server(input, output, session):

    @render.download(filename="file.docx")
    def download2():
        #create document object
        doc = docx.Document()

        #add content to doc
        doc.add_paragraph("Here is a paragraph please.")

        #save document
        with io.BytesIO() as buf:
            doc.save(buf)
            yield buf.getvalue()


app = App(app_ui, server)
