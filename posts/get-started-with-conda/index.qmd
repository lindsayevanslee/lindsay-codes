conda vs venv?

anaconda or miniconda?


https://njfberg.medium.com/macbook-setup-for-a-ml-engineer-using-homebrew-6ba183773d19

brew install --cask miniconda
conda init zsh

restart terminal

create environment in VSCode:
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments

says it should use the requiremnets file automatically, but it didn't for me
tried to create an environment in the command line myself using

conda install --file requirements.txt

and it still couldn't find the packages. Asked GitHub copilot, and it said it may be I need to add a channel. so added conda-forge and that removed this error, and gave error for only 2 packages

conda config --add channels conda-forge

couldn't find channels for these two packages, so need to install them with pip
wasn't sure how to specify that with a requirements.txt file, but it seems like it would be better with a conda environment file, so asked github copilot to help me convert my rquirements.txt with environment.yml

conda env create -f environment.yml

https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.6.1/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#create-env-file-manually

after making sure I specified version for pip dependencies with == instad of =, it worked!

right now, keeping both requirments.txt and environment.yml because requirments.txt is used in the github actions I have set up. I also notice my actions uses different python version than I'm using locally. i'll worry about that later

VSCode point and click way to create conda environment also recognizes the environment.yml file instead of the requirements file
