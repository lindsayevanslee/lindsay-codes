tried to load directly from raw jpg output in github repo, doesn't work--gives "can't read jpg" error

trying to load from a different website.....-\> unoptimized version just gets stuck and doesn't finish, using optimized version does work!!!!

link to github output -\> works! but repo must be public! (DUH)

maybe linking directly to github will work now with public repo -\> nope, gives error about redirects
