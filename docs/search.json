    "text": "My team at work maintained a dashboard related to COVID-19 that included screenshots of graphs online that needed to be updated daily. I had recently taken a little LinkedIn Learning course called Web Scraping with Python and thought this could be a cool opportunity to try that out. The course doesn’t really talk about webscraping screenshots, but it helped give me some of the foundational knowledge and vocabulary.\nAfter a lot of trial and error, here is an small script I came up with. This script cycles through a python dictionary of directions to specific locations, captures the screenshot, and saves it. One element of the dictionary contains the URL where the screenshot is, an XPATH direction to the location of the screenshot on the page, the frame number, and the name of the file that it should be saved to. The XPATH may give you a list of multiple web elements (or “frames”), so the frame number is needed to tell the program which element of that list to save.\nThis script doesn’t work exactly anymore, because these web pages have changed. That’s one major drawback: it’s very unstable and sensitive to change. And because of that, we didn’t end up implementing this at work. But this same script structure could be used for different purposes in the future.\n\n##import packages -----------\nfrom selenium import webdriver\nfrom selenium.webdriver.common.by import By\nfrom time import sleep\nfrom datetime import date\n\n\n## set up --------\n\n#open driver\ndriver = webdriver.Safari()\n\n#create function to see full page\nS = lambda X: driver.execute_script('return document.body.parentNode.scroll'+X)\n\n#get today's date\ntoday = date.today().strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")\n\n#dictionary of screenshots to capture\ndict_urls = [\n    {\n        \"id\": 1, \n        \"url\": 'https://insight.livestories.com/s/v2/1-2-case-counts/c4f65175-2433-47b7-b112-d62cf719af71',\n        \"xpath\": \"//main//iframe\",\n        \"frame_number\": 11,\n        \"filename\": 'weekly-covid-19-test-positivity-rate'\n    },\n        {\n        \"id\": 2, \n        \"url\": 'https://insight.livestories.com/s/v2/1-4-geographic-data/6bb3072d-e622-4b84-9555-7b0ef390b354',\n        \"xpath\": \"//main//iframe\",\n        \"frame_number\": 0,\n        \"filename\": '14-day-testing-rate-per-100000-pop'\n    },\n        {\n        \"id\": 3, \n        \"url\": 'https://insight.livestories.com/s/v2/1-4-geographic-data/6bb3072d-e622-4b84-9555-7b0ef390b354',\n        \"xpath\": \"//main//iframe\",\n        \"frame_number\": 1,\n        \"filename\": '14-day-case-rate-per-100000-pop'\n    },\n        {\n        \"id\": 4, \n        \"url\": 'https://insight-editor.livestories.com/s/v2/1.1-data-dashboard/5d1c9c7a-1eb4-4e9c-82ab-efeaa6258cad',\n        \"xpath\": \"//div[contains(@class, 'css-1bedmrb') and contains(@class, 'erxya8v2')]/div[contains(@class, 'css-rpv578') and contains(@class, 'ezdhjma0')]\",\n        \"frame_number\": 9,\n        \"filename\": 'hrts'\n    }\n    ]\n\n\n## screenshots ------------------------\n\n## loop through dictionary of screenshots\nfor i in range(len(dict_urls)):\n    #go to URL\n    driver.get(url = dict_urls[i]['url'])\n    sleep(3)\n\n    #set window size to full page\n    driver.set_window_size(S('Width'),S('Height')) # May need manual adjustment   \n    sleep(3)\n\n    #find set of frames\n    myframe = driver.find_elements(By.XPATH, dict_urls[i]['xpath'])\n\n    #print needed figure\n    myframe[dict_urls[i]['frame_number']].screenshot(dict_urls[i]['filename'] + \"_\" + today + '.png')\n\n## close driver ----------------------------------\ndriver.quit()\nprint(\"end...\")"

    "title": "Drawing a custom map for Power BI",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In Power BI it’s fairly easy to generate a map with location data that fits typical geographical boundaries like countries or states. If you want to draw a very custom map, it becomes more difficult. This is a way I figured out that seems much more complicated than it needs to be. I’m sure (I hope) there is an easier way that I’ll discover later.\nCurrently Power BI has multiple built-in mapping visualizations. You can draw custom shapes with the “Shape Map”, but it will be on a blank white background. I wanted my map to lay on top of a typical street map. The ArcGIS visualization makes this possible.\nIf you have an ArcGIS license, you can draw your custom maps within ArcGIS itself and access them via Power BI. This didn’t work for me for a couple reasons: 1. I didn’t have a license, and 2. I don’t know if you can connect your data in Power BI to reference layers you create within ArcGIS. So that makes I need to find a way to have custom location data within Power BI formatted in such a way that it is parseable by the ArcGIS visualization. After lots of digging (ArcGIS’s documentation is lacking), I found that custom shapes can be read from Power BI data in an “EsriJSON format”.\nFirst, I drew my map in Google Earth. Start a new project (it works best in Chrome), and click “New feature” -&gt; “Draw line or shape”.\n\nTrace out your shape, and give it a name. When you’ve finished drawing your map, go to the “…” menu and click “Export as KML file”. I don’t really know what a KML is, but from what I can tell it’s a map format that Google likes to use.\n\nNext, the KML file needs to be converted to a form of JSON called GeoJSON. Again, don’t ask me what a GeoJSON is, but from context clues I’m gonna say it’s a JSON for geographic data.\n\n#open necessary libraries\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n#read in kml file\nmap_geo &lt;- sf::st_read(\"Example Project.kml\")\n\n#spit it back out again as a GeoJSON\nmap_geo %&gt;% \n  st_zm() %&gt;% #remove the Z dimension from the object\n  st_write(\"Example Project.geojson\")\n\nGeoJSON isn’t good enough for finicky ArcGIS/Power BI however, so we need to do a bit more wrangling to create a table that has shape data in an EsriJSON format. This website and this question on the ArcGIS forum helped me figure out what this mysterious EsriJSON needed to look like.\n\n#open necessary libraries\nlibrary(jsonlite)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n#read in geojson file\nlist_json &lt;- read_json(\"Example Project.geojson\")\n\n#wrangle into EsriJSON format\ndf_parsed &lt;- list_json$features %&gt;%\n  map_dfr(.f = function(lst_elm) {\n    lst_elm %&gt;%\n      enframe() %&gt;%\n      pivot_wider()\n  }) %&gt;%\n  unnest_wider(properties) %&gt;%\n  select(-type) %&gt;%\n  unnest_wider(geometry) %&gt;%\n  mutate(coordinates = unlist(coordinates, recursive = FALSE)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(coordinates = map(coordinates, toJSON, digits = 20)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(coordinates = as.character(coordinates)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(coordinates = str_replace(coordinates, \"\\\\]$\", '\\\\]\\\\}')) %&gt;%\n  mutate(coordinates = str_replace(coordinates, \"\\\\[\", '\\\\{\"rings\": \\\\[')) %&gt;%\n  mutate(coordinates = str_replace_all(coordinates, \"\\\\],\\\\[\", \",\"))\n\n\n#print csv with EsriJSON column\nwrite_csv(df_parsed, file = \"Example Project.csv\")\n\nFinally, load this csv file into your Power BI report, put an ArcGIS visualization on your report canvas, and use the coordinates column in the “Location” field to create your custom map.\n\nIf you create relationships between this table and other data in your model, then you can overlay more data on this map via coloring, sizing, and tooltips.\nThat’s it! Easy! I’m gonna go take a nap."

One day I was scrolling and stumbled upon this little gadget by Pimoroni: the Inky Frame 7.3”, a fun little e-ink screen that you can program with micropython. I bought it without much a plan for what I would use it for, but thought it would be a fun excuse to practice my python skills. I soon got the idea to combine my loves: I spend all my free time and money at the Belcourt Theatre in Nashville, and thought it would be cool to use the screen as a little display that shows the showtimes for the day.\nAccomplishing this means several things have to happen:\nHere I go through what I did for each of these steps.

    "text": "Automate the jpg update\nGitHub Actions can be used to execute scripts on a schedule and make commits to the repository. I used this guide to set up a GitHub Action that would run the spider and generate the jpg every day in the early morning. The syntax for defining the schedule is called cron, and this website is super helpful for figuring out how to configure the cron syntax to do what you want.\nThis GitHub Action requires giving the workflows read/write permissions by enabling: Settings &gt; Actions &gt; General &gt; Workflow Permissions &gt; Read and write permissions. The workflow is defined by a YAML file that I’ve called .github/workflows/actions.yml in the GitHub repository. The script runs the spider, runs the belcourt_generate_image.py script, and then commits the resulting jpg to the repository.\nA second GitHub Action is needed to update the GitHub Pages deployment every time the jpg is updated. By going to Settings &gt; Pages, you can configure the deployment of the webpage. GitHub automatically provides an Action template for you, and there is additional detail in the documentation. One change I made to the YAML file was to schedule the deployment to run after the first action that updates the jpg. I wanted to do this by triggering the deployment after the new changes were committed to the repository. I found this blog that was trying to do the same thing, but I couldn’t get it to work. It’s got something to do with setting SSH keys, which I’ll figure out at a later date. Instead I again used cron to schedule the deployment to run half an hour after the first action, which should be enough time for the jpg generation to finish."

    "title": "Making my own box office sign with Scrapy and an Inky Frame",
    "section": "Automate the Inky Frame refresh",
    "text": "Automate the Inky Frame refresh\nThe final step in this process is to automate the Inky Frame to refresh the image every day at a certain time. This is where I ran into some trouble.\nThe Inky Frame will run anything saved as main.py when it starts up. If main.py is set to:\n\n#run showtimes_from_web.py on start-up\nwith open(\"showtimes_from_web.py\") as f:\n    exec(f.read())\n\nthen my script showtimes_from_web.py will run on start-up, which pulls down the jpg from the GitHub page and displays it on the screen. The screen will start up when it is plugged in to USB power or when the battery pack is turned on. However, I don’t want to have to start up the screen manually each day, and I also don’t want to leave it plugged in all the time, so I need to find a way to get it to refresh itself while on battery power.\nI did a bunch of searching, and there are some helper functions out there that seemed promising.\nI tried a bunch of things first. I tried adding inky_frame.sleep_for(1) to main.py which should theoretically cause it to go to sleep for a minute and then start back up, but that didn’t trigger another run of main.py. I also tried adding this to the showtimes_from_web.py script itself, but that also didn’t work. I tried running another gc.collect() at the end of showtimes_from_web.py in order to ensure that as much of the RAM was available as possible, but that also didn’t work. I tried to find a way to “close” the jpg (the showtimes_from_web.py script has an open_file command, so I figured, maybe it needs to be closed again in order for the script to truly terminate), but it doesn’t seem to be needed because it looks like the decode function called directly after open_file contains a closing function within it.\nIn order to see if the sleep_for() function does wake the frame back up after it sleeps, I tried putting it at the beginning of the main.py function instead of at the end. It does indeed wake back up and continue running main.py. I thought there might be some issue with the showtimes_from_web.py fully finishing and perhaps the sleep_for() script never actually gets executed when it is at the end of main.py. One indicator that the script isn’t fully finishing is that the busy symbol on the screen doesn’t go away after the screen is refreshed.\nI tried following this blog using timers but this also didn’t work. I could see the timer was working but it didn’t spark a refresh, which was more evidence that there is an issue with the showtimes script fully finishing.\nThen I noticed that there was a file on my Inky Frame called state.json that seemed to indicate the script was continuing to run. I tried deleting this file by using inky_helper.clear_state(). the console. After doing this and including sleep_for() at the end of main.py, I was able to trigger a refresh when it was plugged in to USB power! But on battery power, it still didn’t work.\nAfter months of googling and trying new things, I saw that others have posted about having the same sort of issue on both the Pimoroni forums and in their GitHub issues. In that thread someone posts a patch for micropython that they say solves the issue. I tried installing this patch, and it does seem like it prevents the showtimes script from getting stuck and not fully finishing. However, after running sleep_for(), the script just stops and doesn’t start main.py from the beginning as I want.\nI reread the thread on the forum a few times and noticed that the original poster actually executes their graphics.update() and sleep_for() commands within a while loop. When I add this loop to my own script, like this:\n\n#updated main.py\nimport inky_frame\n\nwhile True:\n  \n    with open(\"showtimes_from_web.py\") as f:\n        exec(f.read())\n        \n    inky_frame.sleep_for(1)\n\n…it does successfully cause a refresh after the screen sleeps! We’re getting closer! However after the first refresh, I got a strange EPERM error. After further copying the techniques of the original poster and adding some error logging to my scripts, I saw the error was occurring at the uos.mount() command in showtimes_from_web.py at the second run-through. I found the documentation for uos, and saw that uos.mount() throws this EPERM error when the file system is already mounted. I tried adding a uos.umount() command at the very end of the showtimes_from_web.py script, and this seems to have solved the issue! The screen refreshes continuously!\nFinally, the moment of truth…does it refresh continuously when on battery power? I unplug the frame, turn on the battery pack, perform a reset (by holding down the A, E, and reset buttons), and wait…and it works! The screen refreshes on its own!\n\n\n\n\nIt me\n\n\n\nAll of the scripts that I used on the Inky Frame (these are the only ones loaded–I deleted all other default examples and libraries that it comes with) are in the inky_frame_scripts folder of the GitHub repository. As a last step, I increased the sleep time to 60 minutes with sleep_for(60). Hopefully this doesn’t drain the battery too quickly. I may further increase it later.\nNow I’ll finally be able to sleep at night. Until I come up with another silly idea."
