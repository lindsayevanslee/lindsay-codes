They have student pricing and also a “mini” version that isn’t as expensive. I think you could do basically everything I have done so far with the mini version, except for the emojis.\nI am using Flow for sketching glyphs."

    "text": "Steps\n\nGetting started\n\nCreate new font in Glyphs\nSet parameters under Font Info: Units per Em, Ascender, Descender, etc\n\n\n\nLower case letters\n\nMake new components to share between glyphs by creating new glyphs with names starting with _\nDraw the letters, and right click to add components\n\n\n\nUpper case letters\n\nSet custom Exports parameters:\n\n\nDisable Subroutines (on): needed because the capitals are very complicated\n\n\nCopy sketches into glyph, and set size\nUse “Trace Image” plugin to trace the image\nClean up\nDelete image\n\n\n\nEmojis\n\nSet custom Font parameters:\n\n\nUse Typo Metrics (on)\n\n\nSet custom Masters parameters:\n\n\nhheaAscender, hheaDescender, hheaLineGap: needed to avoid clipping\n\n\nSet custom Export parameters:\n\n\nExport sbix Table: needed for emojis to render\nSBIX to SVG: needed to increase support for color font\n\n\nCreate new glyph called “_emoji_origin”, set width to be the same as the UPM for the font, and put small path in the bottom left corner where the emoji’s bottom left corner will be anchored\nCreate new glyph with the emoji needed (either generate from glyph list or add directly by using the exact name or unicode)\nAdd component _emoji_origin to emoji and decompose\nPrepare image files for emoji:\n\n\nOriginal image should be square png with transparent background\nCreate a copies of images with different resolutions. For example set first image as resolution 512, with a height and width that works when you paste image into the glyph. Next image should have half resolution (256) and half height and width\nSet names of files as all “glyphname resolution.png”, eg “slightlySmilingFace 512.png”\n\n\nUse script Add sbix Images to Font to batch-import your emoji images\n\n\nThis is a mekkablue script that can be added from Plugin Manager -&gt; Scripts\nIf it doesn’t work, you can read error messages by opening the Macro Panel"

    "section": "",
    "text": "My team at work maintained a dashboard related to COVID-19 that included screenshots of graphs online that needed to be updated daily. I had recently taken a little LinkedIn Learning course called Web Scraping with Python and thought this could be a cool opportunity to try that out. The course doesn’t really talk about webscraping screenshots, but it helped give me some of the foundational knowledge and vocabulary.\nAfter a lot of trial and error, here is an small script I came up with. This script cycles through a python dictionary of directions to specific locations, captures the screenshot, and saves it. One element of the dictionary contains the URL where the screenshot is, an XPATH direction to the location of the screenshot on the page, the frame number, and the name of the file that it should be saved to. The XPATH may give you a list of multiple web elements (or “frames”), so the frame number is needed to tell the program which element of that list to save.\nThis script doesn’t work exactly anymore, because these web pages have changed. That’s one major drawback: it’s very unstable and sensitive to change. And because of that, we didn’t end up implementing this at work. But this same script structure could be used for different purposes in the future.\n\n##import packages -----------\nfrom selenium import webdriver\nfrom selenium.webdriver.common.by import By\nfrom time import sleep\nfrom datetime import date\n\n\n## set up --------\n\n#open driver\ndriver = webdriver.Safari()\n\n#create function to see full page\nS = lambda X: driver.execute_script('return document.body.parentNode.scroll'+X)\n\n#get today's date\ntoday = date.today().strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")\n\n#dictionary of screenshots to capture\ndict_urls = [\n    {\n        \"id\": 1, \n        \"url\": 'https://insight.livestories.com/s/v2/1-2-case-counts/c4f65175-2433-47b7-b112-d62cf719af71',\n        \"xpath\": \"//main//iframe\",\n        \"frame_number\": 11,\n        \"filename\": 'weekly-covid-19-test-positivity-rate'\n    },\n        {\n        \"id\": 2, \n        \"url\": 'https://insight.livestories.com/s/v2/1-4-geographic-data/6bb3072d-e622-4b84-9555-7b0ef390b354',\n        \"xpath\": \"//main//iframe\",\n        \"frame_number\": 0,\n        \"filename\": '14-day-testing-rate-per-100000-pop'\n    },\n        {\n        \"id\": 3, \n        \"url\": 'https://insight.livestories.com/s/v2/1-4-geographic-data/6bb3072d-e622-4b84-9555-7b0ef390b354',\n        \"xpath\": \"//main//iframe\",\n        \"frame_number\": 1,\n        \"filename\": '14-day-case-rate-per-100000-pop'\n    },\n        {\n        \"id\": 4, \n        \"url\": 'https://insight-editor.livestories.com/s/v2/1.1-data-dashboard/5d1c9c7a-1eb4-4e9c-82ab-efeaa6258cad',\n        \"xpath\": \"//div[contains(@class, 'css-1bedmrb') and contains(@class, 'erxya8v2')]/div[contains(@class, 'css-rpv578') and contains(@class, 'ezdhjma0')]\",\n        \"frame_number\": 9,\n        \"filename\": 'hrts'\n    }\n    ]\n\n\n## screenshots ------------------------\n\n## loop through dictionary of screenshots\nfor i in range(len(dict_urls)):\n    #go to URL\n    driver.get(url = dict_urls[i]['url'])\n    sleep(3)\n\n    #set window size to full page\n    driver.set_window_size(S('Width'),S('Height')) # May need manual adjustment   \n    sleep(3)\n\n    #find set of frames\n    myframe = driver.find_elements(By.XPATH, dict_urls[i]['xpath'])\n\n    #print needed figure\n    myframe[dict_urls[i]['frame_number']].screenshot(dict_urls[i]['filename'] + \"_\" + today + '.png')\n\n## close driver ----------------------------------\ndriver.quit()\nprint(\"end...\")"
